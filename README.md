# Multifaceted AI Assistant App (Project Jarvis)

## Overview

This application is a comprehensive AI-powered assistant designed to help users manage various aspects of their lives, including finance, health,  education, and personal tasks. It aims to provide a seamless, integrated experience leveraging AI for personalized insights and automation.

## Features

*   **Finance Management:** Transaction tracking, budgeting, investment advice (via Plaid integration & AI insights).
*   **Health Adviser:** Recipe recommendations, meal planning, symptom checking, fitness tracking (integrations planned).
*   **Education Mentoring:** Personalized learning paths, content suggestions, progress tracking (future scope).
*   **Personal Assistant:** Task management, scheduling, reminders, smart home integration (future scope).

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Microservices using Python, Django, Django Rest Framework
*   **AI Core:** Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, SpaCy (planned)
*   **Frontend:** React (Vite), JavaScript/TypeScript
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **API Gateway:** Nginx
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **External APIs:** Plaid (Finance)

## Setup Instructions (Local Development)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Docker & Docker Compose installed ([https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started))
    *   Git installed
    *   A code editor (like VS Code)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd multifaceted-ai-app
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env` (or `copy .env.example .env` on Windows)
    *   Edit `.env` and fill in your actual secrets and configuration (Database credentials, Django secret key, Plaid API keys for sandbox, etc.).

4.  **Build and Run using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d # Run in detached mode
    ```
    *   This will build the images for all services and start them.
    *   The first build might take some time.

5.  **Apply Database Migrations (Important!):**
    *   Once the containers are running, apply migrations for each Django service:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec auth_service python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec finance_service python manage.py migrate
    # docker-compose exec health_service python manage.py migrate # Add for other services
    # ...
    ```
    *   You might also want to create a superuser for the Django admin (if you configure admin access for a service):
    ```bash
    # Example for auth_service:
    docker-compose exec auth_service python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Access the application:**
    *   Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your configured frontend port)
    *   API Gateway (for testing endpoints): [http://localhost:8000/api/](http://localhost:8000/api/) (or your configured gateway port)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Example for finance service tests
docker-compose exec finance_service python manage.py test finance_api

# Example for frontend tests (if configured in package.json)
# docker-compose exec frontend npm run test
```

## Stopping the Application

```bash
docker-compose down # Stop and remove containers
# Add -v to remove volumes (like the database data!) if you want a clean restart:
# docker-compose down -v
```

## Services Overview

*   **api-gateway:** Nginx reverse proxy routing requests to backend services. Runs on port 8000 by default in this example.
*   **auth-service:** Handles user registration, login, authentication (JWT). Listens internally (e.g., on port 8001).
*   **finance-service:** Manages financial accounts, transactions, budgets, Plaid integration. Listens internally (e.g., on port 8002).
*   **health-service:** Manages recipes, health logs, etc. (Work In Progress). Listens internally (e.g., on port 8003).
*   **education-service:** Manages courses, learning paths, etc. (Work In Progress). Listens internally (e.g., on port 8004).
*   **assistant-service:** Manages tasks, reminders, etc. (Work In Progress). Listens internally (e.g., on port 8005).
*   **ai-core-service:** Serves ML models for predictions/insights. (Work In Progress). Listens internally (e.g., on port 8050).
*   **frontend:** React user interface. Runs on port 3000 by default in this example.
*   **postgres_db:** PostgreSQL database shared by services (can be split later).
